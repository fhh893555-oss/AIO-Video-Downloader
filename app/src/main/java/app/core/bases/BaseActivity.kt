/**
 * Base activity class that provides common functionality and infrastructure for all activities in the application.
 *
 * This abstract class serves as the foundation for all activities in the app, implementing
 * common patterns and functionality to reduce code duplication and ensure consistent behavior
 * across the application. It extends LanguageAwareActivity for localization support and
 * implements BaseActivityInf interface to provide standardized activity operations.
 *
 * Core features and responsibilities:
 * - Comprehensive lifecycle management with proper resource cleanup
 * - Runtime permission handling with user-friendly dialogs and fallbacks
 * - Smooth activity transitions and animations for better user experience
 * - System UI customization (status bar, navigation bar theming)
 * - Haptic feedback integration through vibration services
 * - Global crash handling and exception management
 * - Multi-language support with dynamic language switching
 * - Advertisement integration and management
 * - Storage management with scoped storage compatibility
 * - Memory leak prevention through weak reference patterns
 * - Back press handling with double-tap confirmation
 *
 * Subclasses should override the template methods to provide specific functionality
 * while inheriting the common infrastructure and behavior.
