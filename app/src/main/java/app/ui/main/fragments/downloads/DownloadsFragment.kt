/**
 * A fragment that serves as the primary container for managing download tasks within the application.
 *
 * This fragment implements a tabbed interface using a [ViewPager] to organize download activities into
 * two main categories:
 * - **Finished Tasks:** View and manage completed downloads, including support for a secured "Private Folder"
 *   accessible via authentication.
 * - **Active Tasks:** Monitor and control ongoing download processes.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Integration with [MotherActivity] for navigation and UI synchronization.
 * - Secure handling of private files using [authenticate] and filtered list adapters.
 * - Dynamic UI updates for file counts and storage status.
 * - Loading state management with [LottieAnimationView] to enhance user experience during initialization.
 * - Navigation shortcuts to add new download tasks via [VideoLinkPasteEditor].
