/**
 * A fragment responsible for displaying and managing the list of completed download tasks.

 * synchronization, such as updating task counts and toggling visibility of empty state views.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Displaying a list of completed downloads via [FinishedTasksListAdapter].
 * - Handling click and long-click events on finished tasks to open files or show options.
 * - Dynamic UI updates for empty states and navigation to active downloads.
 * - Integration with [DownloadsFragment] to manage private folder visibility and titles.
